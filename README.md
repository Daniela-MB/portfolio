# Data Analyst/Scientist 

### Summary
I am a professional with a First-class Honours in Higher Diploma in Data Analytics for Business, and a PhD and Masterâ€™s in Ecotoxicology. With over six years of research experience, I excel in data collection, transformation, and organization to support informed decision-making. My focus is on Python and Machine Learning, complemented by foundational skills in SQL, Tableau, and R. I have well-developed organizational and teamwork abilities, guided by values of integrity, respect, and ethics. My goal is to apply my expertise to drive data-driven business solutions.

  - Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms identified frequent itemsets and generated association rules, guiding improvements in store layouts, websites, marketing, and bundling strategies.
  - FP-Growth algorithm was 1.75 times faster than the Apriori algorithm.

  - The ARIMA model was used to forecast Coursera's stock prices, achieving a low RMSE (0.40) and explaining 88% of the data variability.

- <a href="https://github.com/Daniela-MB/Capstone_project.git" target="_blank">Capstone Project</a>

  - Applied three tree-based machine learning models to estimate the material's ability to adsorb CO<sub>2</sub>.
  - Achieved success criteria by exceeding the minimum recall and precision threshold of 0.80, optimizing for true positive instances.
  - Utilized SMOTE, Stratified K-Fold, and Random Search to optimize hyperparameters, validate the model, and mitigate bias risk.
